sequencing data from pox viruses is complicated by the rather large genome size and by the presence of inverted terminal repeats, but well-designed wet lab and bioinformatic workflows can handle these particularities.","Galaxy and its huge set of tools are flexible enough to handle half-genome sequencing data efficiently.","A mapping-based approach can result in high-quality consensus genome
