Once the location is identified, finding and correcting the error is often trivial.","When debugging an API test failure, first determine what endpoint is being utilized; then look in `lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/api/` to locate the controller that handles that enpoint. The controller will point you to a manager module, which is where you're most likely to find the bug.","To locate the probable cause of a Selenium test failure, run Selenium with `GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_HEADLESS=false` to watch the browser step through the test.","When debugging a runtime error, use pdb or any other interactive Python debugger to step through the code to identify the location of the error. Remember to use `GALAXY_CONFIG_DEBUG=1` to enable debugging.","If you find a bug in a code block that is not covered by a test, before you fix the bug, write a test exposing the bug; run the test to ensure it fails; then fix the bug; then run the test again to ensure it passes.","Write useful and property formatted commit messages.","Pdb is your
