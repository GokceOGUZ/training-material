The tutorials in this section show how to detect evidence for
genetic variants in next-generation sequencing data, a process termed
variant calling.

Of equal importance, they also demonstrate how you can interpret, for
a range of different organisms, the resulting sets of variants by
predicting their molecular effects on genes and proteins, by
annotating previously observed variants with published knowledge, and
by trying to link phenotypes of the sequenced samples to their variant
genotypes.

???
Presenter notes contain extra information which might be useful if you intend to use these slides for teaching.

Press `P` again to switch presenter notes off

Press `C` to create a new window where the same presentation will be displayed.
This window is linked to the main window. Changing slides on one will cause the
slide to change on the other.

Useful when presenting.

# What is Exome sequencing?

---

### Exome sequencing

= Whole exome sequencing (WES or WXS)

Sequencing of all expressed protein-coding genes in a genome

---

### Exome in Humans

- ~180,000 exons
- 1% of the human genome
- ~30 million base pairs

---

### Goal of exome sequencing

Identify genetic variation that is responsible for both Mendelian
and common diseases without the high costs associated with
whole-genome sequencing

Exome sequencing is the most efficient way to identify the
genetic variants in all of an individual&apos;s genes

---

### Limits

Exome sequencing can not identify genetic variation in

- All genes
- Mitochondrial genes
- “Structural variants”
- Triplet repeat disorders
- Other copy number variants
- Introns
- “Uniparental disomy”
- Control sequences
- Epigenetic changes
- Gene-gene (epistatic) interactions

---

## 2 tutorials for training on exome sequencing data analysis

---

### Same goal

Identify and annotate genetic variants in a family with two
parents and a child exome data

---

### Similar data analysis approach

![Pipeline showing data preprocessing followed by variant calling with GATK/FreeBayes/Samtools/Naïve/VarScan going through filtering to a final VCF file. This is sent to GEMINI for ppost processing and variant analysis.](../../images/genVAST.png)

---

 ### 2 tutorials

- [Introductory tutorial](/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/exome-seq/tutorial.html)
- [Detailed tutorial](/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/dip/tutorial.html)
